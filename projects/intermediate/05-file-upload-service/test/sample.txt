This is a sample text file for testing the file upload service.

You can use this file to test the upload functionality:
  node test/test-upload.js test/sample.txt

Or upload it through the web interface at http://localhost:3000

The file upload service supports:
- Multiple file uploads
- Progress tracking
- File validation
- Stream-based processing
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events

This is just a plain text file, but the service supports any file type
unless you configure allowed extensions.
